## Setup Development Environment

Before contributing to Diffulex, please follow the instructions below to setup.

1. Fork Diffulex ([fork](https://github.com/zhijie-group/Diffulex/fork)) on GitHub and clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<your username>/Diffulex.git  # use the SSH protocol
    cd Diffulex

    git remote add upstream git@github.com:zhijie-group/Diffulex.git
    ```

2. Setup a development environment:

    ```bash
    uv venv --seed .venv  # use `python3 -m venv .venv` if you don't have `uv`

    source .venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel "build[uv]"
    uv pip install --requirements requirements-dev.txt
    ```

3. Setup the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hooks:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install --install-hooks
    ```

Then you are ready to rock. Thanks for contributing to Diffulex!

## Install Develop Version

To install Diffulex in an "editable" mode, run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --no-build-isolation --verbose --editable .
```

in the main directory. This installation is removable by:

```bash
python3 -m pip uninstall diffulex
```

We also recommend installing Diffulex in a more manual way for better control over the build process, by compiling the C++ extensions first and set the `PYTHONPATH`. See the documentation for detailed instructions.

## Lint Check

To check the linting, run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Test Locally

To run the tests, start by building the project as described in the [Setup Development Environment](#setup-development-environment) section.

Then you can rerun the tests with:

```bash
python3 -m pytest testing
```
